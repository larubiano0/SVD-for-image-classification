SVD Factorization has shown promising results in tasks such as reducing the number of parameters in neural networks.

It has allowed to reduce one of the most common problems in Machine Learning: Overfitting.

Also, layers have been incorporated into convolutional networks, where data covariance matrices are decomposed by means of SVD: facilitating image classification. Improving Accuracy Metrics. Reducing computation time.
